# Unkeggd

This is an app I made to interact with a beer API consisting of beers and categories. In it, you can
* GET categories and beers
* PUT changes to existing categories and beers
* POST new categories and beers
* DELETE categories and beers

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It uses: 

* [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for HTPP requests.
* [React-Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) for routing.
* [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for CSS-in-JS styling.
* [React-redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux) for state management
* [Redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) middleware for handling asynchronous logic and side effects.
