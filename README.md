# Unkeggd

This is an app I made to interact with a beer API consisting of beers and categories. In it, you can
* GET categories and beers
* PUT changes to existing categories and beers
* POST new categories and beers
* DELETE categories and beers

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) for HTPP requests.

It uses [Styled-Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for CSS-in-JS styling.
